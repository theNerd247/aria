Instructions 
------------

The report should answer the question, "How does a wheeled robot calculate its
position and speed, and how does it keep from running into objects?"  A
suggested outline follows.



Introduction:

Describe the dead reckoning problem for our robot.  This should include
discussion of wheel encoders, the forward kinematic model, and integrating
incremental changes to get total displacement.

Discuss the sonar range sensing device.  Be sure to cover the time of flight
principle and also error modes for sonar (reflectance away from the sensor,
interference from other sonar emitters, etc.).

Methodology:

Explain the code from your Aria programs for the "square" task and the "sonar"
task.  Choose one of the three remaining tasks (either "wander", "s-curve", or
"Bug2") and explain your code for that task.  These explanations need only cover
the parts that are not in the sample code I sent you to start with.  (See the
code below for clarification.)
	



Even if you did not complete any of the programming assignments you can still
write at least part of the report (at least the introduction).  Please contact
me with questions or problems,
