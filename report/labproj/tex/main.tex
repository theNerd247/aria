	The robot localization problem is a key problem faced in modern day mobile
	robots. This problem involves obtaining ``clean'' data about the robot's
	environment, determining the current location of the robot, and deciding on an
	optimal travel path towards a desired location. The robot receives information
	from its environment via robotic sensors (wheel encoders and sonar range
	finders). The robot then uses the sensor data and information about its
	previous location to determine its current location.

	Mobile robot simulation software is a useful tool for designing and testing
	localization algorithms. Aria is a C++ SDK used for developing and
	testing mobile robot software. MobileSim is a simulation software
	for testing mobile robot software which uses Aria. Both Aria and MobileSim
	were used to develop and test mobile robot software.
