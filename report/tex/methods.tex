\section{Example Robot Programs}
The following example robot programs make use of the Aria and MobileSim
softwares. The source code can be found in~\ref{appendixA}.

\subsection{Aria Basics}
% control flow
% actions
% simulation? 

\subsection{Square Path Robot}
The square robot program is a basic program that drives a robot in a square
path. Each side of the square is two meters long and the goal was simply to
drive this path as accurately as possible. 

\subsubsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Procedure for Navigating a Square Path}
\label{alg1}
\begin{algorithmic}
	\FOR{$i=0$ to $3$}
		\STATE set the next robot position 
		\WHILE{robot has not reached desired goal}
			\STATE nothing
		\ENDWHILE
	\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
